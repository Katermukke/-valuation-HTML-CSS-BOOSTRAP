A website has many interests for an association, especially in terms of visibility (it is up to you to choose an association, whether real or fictitious, the important thing will be your code).

The site must contain at least 2 pages:

1. A page about the association.
2. A page advertising national events (you choose the theme of the event, the d  ate, the details).

Of course, the site will have to be responsive and at the request of the client the interface will have to be thought mobile first!
